Exercise Title: Student Grades Analyzer
ğŸ“˜ Problem Statement:
You are building a simple program to analyze student grades. The program should:
    Ask the user to input the number of students.
    For each student:
        Ask for their name.
        Ask for their grade (as a string, but convert it to a number).
        Store the data in a dictionary, where the key is the student name and the value is their grade.
    Add all grades to a list.
    After all data is entered:
        Print all student names and their grades.
        Print the average grade.
        Print the highest and lowest grade.
        Print a list of students who passed (grade >= 50).
